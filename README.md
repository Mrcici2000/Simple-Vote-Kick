# Simple-Vote-Kick
This is a plugin allows you to kick a player of a minecraft server if they are afk or just annoying.

# SimpleVoteKick

- SimpleVoteKick is a lightweight Minecraft plugin that allows players to vote-kick someone from the server without needing operator permissions.

- It is designed for small friend servers where one player might go AFK, be annoying, or prevent others from sleeping. Instead of giving OP access, players can start a vote and decide together.

# How it works

- Any player can start a vote using the command: /votekick [player]
  
- The player who starts the vote automatically votes YES.
  
- Other players vote using [YES] / [NO] buttons.
  
- The vote runs for a configurable amount of time.
  
# Small server protection

- To prevent abuse on very small servers:
2–3 players online.

- The target player must be AFK for a configurable time.

- If the AFK player becomes active, the vote is canceled.

- 4+ players online
voting can start immediately.

- A configurable (default 1 min) cooldown prevents vote spam.

# Commands 
(it's more like just one command lol)
